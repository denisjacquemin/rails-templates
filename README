= basic.rb rails template

For each rails project, I always start with the same common tasks

Here they are bundled in a rails template

- setting up a git repos
- creating the .gitignore file
- make some directories 'visible' to the git commit
- setting up the database.yml file for development
- installing the haml plugin

== How to use it?

As simple as running this command

rails -m http://github.com/denisj/basic_template.git YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
